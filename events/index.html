  <h3>Open Austin Monthly Events:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Open Gov &amp; Civic Tech Meetup</b> - A monthly meetup for anyone interested in learning more about the growing Open Government and Civic Technology movement. From lightning talks to panels, expect a wide variety of topics that sit at the intersection of data, design, technology, development, government and more. This meetup is always hosted on the 3rd Monday of each month.</li>
      <li><b>Civic Hack Night</b> - A study hall environment to get work done with a supportive and connected community. We begin every meeting with announcements followed by introductions and thereafter, we have a Civic Hacking 101 presentation for newcomers to the scene. Come here if you’re looking to join a project, pitch a project, or learn more about what civic hacking is and how you can help lead the civic tech movement in Austin, TX. We host 2 hack nights a month.</li>
      <li><b>Civic Hack Saturday</b> - Civic Hack Saturday’s are open hack spaces to grab coffee, breakfast tacos and get straight to work. Unlike Civic Hack Night, there are no announcements or intros. This is a casual environment to socialize and/or get work done with fellow Austinites.</li>
  </ul>
