        <title>Kirk Watson Advances Open Government Bills</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/11/texas-senate-unticks-proposals-plug-public-records-loopholes/&quot;&gt;Texas Tribune has reported&lt;/a&gt; that Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, has attached several open government initiatives to a single bill designated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB2328&quot;&gt;HB 2328&lt;/a&gt;, which has passed the Texas Senate. The amended bill now goes back to the House for its approval. The provisions now attached to HB 2328 include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;getting rid of the requirement for a governmental body to get an attorney general opinion before withholding information under the Public Information Act, if it makes a good faith determination that an exception applies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;changing the Public Information Act’s exception for contract bids, so that the exception doesn’t apply once a contract is awarded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;including some contractors in the definition of a “governmental body” obligated to respond to record requests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mandating public access to government information stored on privately-owned accounts and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;providing that public records containing dates of birth can still be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;creating a procedure for the Attorney General to compel a response to a public records request.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/11/texas-senate-unticks-proposals-plug-public-records-loopholes/&quot;&gt;The Tribune&lt;/a&gt; has the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mozilla’s Open Leadership Training can work for Open Austin projects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I joined the Open Austin leadership team, one of my first goals was to identify specific problems in our project management that might impact members’ ability or motivation to contribute. Early on we defined that problem to be that most project ideas are never completed. However, recently we took a good look at what we are as a community and what we want to facilitate. In doing so, we realized that it’s okay for &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; to not be completed; they’re just ideas after all. Rather, it’s a problem when a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; that has made commitments or set expectations never gets completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/project-ideas-750x582.png&quot; alt=&quot;A snapshot of recently updated project ideas on Open Austin’’s Github&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A snapshot of recently updated project ideas on Open Austin’’s Github&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/projects&quot;&gt;dozens of projects&lt;/a&gt; over the years, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Active+Project%22&quot;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt; actively worked on today. However, there are all together still more ideas that have been abandoned, shelved for later, or need leadership. We decided that it’s okay for ideas to be this way, in fact it’s great to have pages of unled or abandoned ideas that a newcomer could pick up and run with. However, it becomes a problem when that newcomer doesn’t have the initiative to start on a new project with no help or to continue working on a project that nobody else wants to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-management-issues&quot;&gt;Project management issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is when projects that have progressed past just an idea or that have commitments, funding, or external stakeholders are not satisfactorily completed. From some less than rigorous study and experience with this over some years, I’ve identified five causes that have prevented projects from being completed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unmet technical requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lost client or target group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analysis paralysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lost interest or commitment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropped out of the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unmet-technical-requirements&quot;&gt;Unmet technical requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most clear problem that often has an easy to understand solution: you get the right technology, right person, or right information to move forward or pivot. For example, Rails (and thus Ruby) was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; new language for web development around the time Code for America started up. This led to a lot of new projects in our communities being developed with Rails. But it didn’t last, and now as other languages and tools have usurped its trendiness, Rails projects may struggle a little harder than others as new members are less interested in contributing to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the right person with technical knowledge and techniques can be just as important as the project’s tools. It can mean the difference between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt&quot;&gt;tech-debted&lt;/a&gt; prototype and a well-engineered project that requires less attention over time, which helps for volunteer projects like ours. Having the right person with the insider technical knowledge also falls under this category. For example, a project for a government body will likely move extremely slowly without the technical knowledge of its legal or procurement matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lost-client-or-target-group&quot;&gt;Lost client or target group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of our completed projects had at least one external stakeholder, including government workers, nonprofits, and community groups. Without dedicated support and communication affordances to maintain that relationship, a project can easily lose steam. Maintaining relationships is hard, but it affects nearly all aspects of a project for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A client can provide direction, a target group can provide research, a stakeholder can provide technical resources, and it can be too hard to replace them before volunteers move on to something more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-paralysis&quot;&gt;Analysis paralysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A challenge to all agile teams is keeping track of their own time and project management. A team practicing waterfall might work well by seeking volunteers only for the near term objectives and then different volunteers for later objectives, but that requires strong leadership over a long time. An agile, iterative project requires shorter management terms but also means the team must know how and when to observe, reflect, make, and repeat over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming paralysis requires the agency to continue even if they lose the ability to seek clarification from a client or target group. Or if the client provides this but not strong direction, a team may spend too much time observing and reflecting. Then they risk never &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; anything. Having the discipline to prototype and potentially throw it all away after testing is critical to iterative work with less managerial overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lost-interest-or-commitment&quot;&gt;Lost interest or commitment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, it’s just hard to stay engaged in a project that loses its novelty. A new project idea to someone is a great motivator to learn, but depending on what they did or did not learn, that motivation can fizzle out. Time management is also critical here as we are a volunteer organization that is focused on personal projects over business-driven projects. Those who don’t align themselves accordingly may suffer from how they perceive the community and vice-versa. This can happen to regular members, leaders, and external stakeholders, each with their own repercussions to their project and the whole community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dropped-out-of-the-community&quot;&gt;Dropped out of the community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, churn is the greatest enemy to any subscription-based endeavor. When people leave something, it’s extremely difficult to get them back, and sometimes they leave with something of great value to the community. That can be replaced in time usually, but in the meantime the consequences can cascade. If someone just ghosted, that also draws concern on a more personal level. As an intentional community based on personal projects, it can affect folks on a more emotional level that isn’t so replaceable. Maintaining a personable level of engagement is critical to a healthy community that significantly affects the other four issues I’ve described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-from-mozilla&quot;&gt;Learning from Mozilla&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Open Austin’s core are our values of open source work and open participation. We share a lot of that with Mozilla, who’s also a great example of getting things done themselves and by enabling others in their own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a leader in open project leadership, they offer this as a sort of service via their &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/&quot;&gt;open leadership training series&lt;/a&gt; (OLTS). I enrolled with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://andyhub.com/concepts/mobile-reporting/&quot;&gt;Mobile-Map-IO&lt;/a&gt; project in their third cohort, which included a couple dozen other participants from around the world. One of the first activities we did was align our values for our individual projects with the community’s values, particularly with Mozilla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://internethealthreport.org/v01/&quot;&gt;internet health report&lt;/a&gt; categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/03/15/five-issues-that-will-determine-the-future-of-internet-health/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Internet_Health_issues_march_2017_cover-1400x770-750x413.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mozilla’s Internet Health Report (image by Mozilla)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mozilla’s Internet Health Report (image by Mozilla)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training series overall is about learning the best practices for working in the open, specifically people who are starting up or leading a project. It’s a mix of a few things, mostly captured by a sort of multimedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/olts-readme-750x422.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the OLTS readme&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of the OLTS readme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reference this readme at nearly every cohort check-in, where we all meet virtually via Vidyo and type on Etherpad, a real-time collaborative notepad, when we have questions or are responding to prompts provided by our lead &lt;a href=&quot;https://acabunoc.github.io/&quot;&gt;Abby&lt;/a&gt;. Before we meet, she sends two options for the whole cohort to meet, giving us a chance to schedule one or the the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/olt3week4convoscreenshot-750x422.png&quot; alt=&quot;A usual video chat with the whole OLTS cohort&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A usual video chat with the whole OLTS cohort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she prepares &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/olt3-trainings&quot;&gt;our cohort Etherpad&lt;/a&gt; with the meeting outline and spaces for us to respond to questions. This gives us chances to participate verbally as well as textually in the conversation, engaging individuals from what they type directly instead of relying on individuals who choose to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/etherpadscreenshot-750x422.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of how we use Etherpad&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of how we use Etherpad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As leaders, it’s important that we learn from and motivate each other. This live document editing is bolstered by more in-depth artifacts developed from these prompts and those listed on the readme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we crafted vision statements, articulated the problems we want to address, and more so that others in the community can better understand the motivation, expected outcomes, and progress without the leaders being present. My Mobile Map IO artifacts are all available on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://andyhub.com/concepts/mobile-reporting/&quot;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;applying-this-with-open-austin&quot;&gt;Applying this with Open Austin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artifacts are also something we can use to check ourselves, as this is generally only what we spend about 20% of our free time on. Keeping tabs on what commitments we can make in our 20% time is something I think we at Open Austin do well by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/cheatsheet-basedef&quot;&gt;BASEDEF&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; logging, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; pplying, &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; uggesting, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; xtending, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; ocumenting, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; vangelizing, and &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; ixing are all ways folks can get involved in an idea for civic innovation. What I’m doing now for example is the B, for blogging, to share what I learned and how I could contribute to our process for improving the issues I’ve outlined. These artifacts we created are examples of the BASEDEF spec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/MMIO-Open-Canvas-750x422.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Open Canvas for my project, similar to the popular Lean and Business Model Canvases.&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Open Canvas for my project, similar to the popular Lean and Business Model Canvases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another artifact we in OLTS used for maintaining a project is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/&quot;&gt;Open Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, something similar to what Open Austin has iterated on with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/civic-tech-canvas/&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Project Planning Canvas&lt;/a&gt;. The canvas can also inform a roadmap, which we started building from day one to guide our direction. In order to deliver (i.e. complete to a degree) a minimally viable experience to a stakeholder, the project team must align on some near- and long-term goals that are defined in a way that stakeholders would care about. Instead of defining technical requirements or jargon-laden statements, an experience-based roadmap should define what a stakeholder would be able to do or experience at each milestone. Defining this way may help with keeping them engaged and acting as good designers, not just good hackers. And this is important, because it’s hard as a stakeholder or user to wait for volunteer―&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/8728551/Hack_for_good_Speculative_labor_app_development_and_the_burden_of_austerity&quot;&gt;often speculative&lt;/a&gt;―labor to yield a desirable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one last OLTS artifact that I felt was important was understanding what we would find welcoming or helpful when first reading about a project. Community is at the center of leading an open project, and without a welcoming experience to that community, a project therein may fail to catch new members. This makes well-designed and welcoming documentation a very high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sanfranannie/4136379024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://andyhub.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sanfranannie-750x563.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Ann Larie Valentine.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Ann Larie Valentine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common way of providing this is with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;, a pleasant way of greeting someone into your project’s home, like the OLTS website. Removing the jargon from our roadmap, readme, and other artifacts is especially important for us because Open Austin is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lunch-and-learn-with-the-austin-innovation-office-designing-for-the-100-tickets-32426014081&quot;&gt;designing for the 100%&lt;/a&gt;: everyone in our city. And like any house’s rules defined on their doormat, we could also define a code of conduct and contribution guidelines to entice folks to start making contributions in any BASEDEF way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, half of the experience of OLTS is having my mentor &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MinnSoe&quot;&gt;Minn&lt;/a&gt; who knows my name, knows my project, and wants to help me succeed. Even though I may start losing motivation, having someone asking me questions and injecting enthusiasm is hugely helpful to staying on point. Part of his goal is to get me ready for Mozilla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/&quot;&gt;Global Sprint&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that my project’s going to be part of some big thing way in advance is a great motivator. Open Austin does something similar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://atxhackforchange.org/&quot;&gt;ATX Hack for Change&lt;/a&gt;, but we don’t really talk it up until the weeks leading up to the event. With a more personal welcoming experience, a constant personal peer presence, and a long-term goal to set, we might see some improvements in membership retention and engagement levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-suggestions&quot;&gt;Some suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have six big takeaways from Mozilla’s OLTS for Open Austin. These are the things I’d like to help lead in our organization:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motivation and alignment with shared community values&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Framework for starting a project from an idea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular engagement with the whole community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ample community technology and resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mentor who knows you and provides 1-on-1 experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-exposure events to nudge long-term goal setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Lege Schedules Transparency Bills for Public Hearings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since last month when we published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2017/03/19/open_government_under_debate_in_tx_legislature&quot;&gt;overview of open government bills&lt;/a&gt; in the state Legislature, one of the bills we’ve been watching has passed the House, one has passed the Senate, one has been rewritten, and seven have been scheduled for public hearings to be held on Monday and Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passed&quot;&gt;Passed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, the House passed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB3107&quot;&gt;HB 3107&lt;/a&gt;, which lets government bodies impose limits on the amount of records they’re required to disclose to a single requestor per month or year (unless the requestors prove they’re employees of news organizations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 29, the Senate passed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=SB407&quot;&gt;SB 407&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow disclosure of contract bids under the Public Information Act after the contract was awarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;out-of-committee&quot;&gt;Out of Committee:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB2328&quot;&gt;HB 2328&lt;/a&gt; is an important bill that’s now out of committee. It would get rid of the requirement for a governmental body to get an attorney general opinion before withholding information under the Public Information Act, if it makes a good faith determination that an exception applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB1258&quot;&gt;HB 1258&lt;/a&gt;, which previously would have prevented anyone from setting up online access to court records currently held by counties, has now been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB1258&quot;&gt;rewritten and toned down&lt;/a&gt;. The current version appears to apply only to the state government. It would allow the state to add new court documents to its database, but it would require the state to get permission from the counties to add the backlog of old documents. Also, when the state collects a fee for public access to court documents, it would have to hand the money over to the counties. This bill &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB1258/?show_all_sponsors=True&quot;&gt;now has 44 sponsors&lt;/a&gt; out of the 150 total representatives, and it is out of committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scheduled-for-hearing&quot;&gt;Scheduled for Hearing:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the House Government Transparency and Operation Committee &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/Committees/MeetingsUpcoming.aspx?Chamber=H&quot;&gt;will hold public hearings&lt;/a&gt; on six open records bills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB526&quot;&gt;HB 526&lt;/a&gt;, which would amend the Public Information Act to entitle only residents to public information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB793&quot;&gt;HB 792&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=SB407&quot;&gt;SB 407&lt;/a&gt;, and would allow disclosure of contract bids under the Public Information Act after the contract was awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB793&quot;&gt;HB 793&lt;/a&gt;, extending the Public Information Act to cover some privately-owned government contractors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB2670&quot;&gt;HB 2670&lt;/a&gt;, supporting public access to government information stored on privately-owned accounts and devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB2710&quot;&gt;HB 2710&lt;/a&gt;, providing that public records containing dates of birth can still be disclosed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB3581&quot;&gt;HB 3581&lt;/a&gt;, a helpful-sounding law requiring agencies to publish a data dictionary and instructions for using any databases that they disclose in response to a public records request, and also requiring them to provide more explanation of why it’s necessary to charge for programming work to fulfill a records request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, on Tuesday, the House Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/Committees/MeetingsUpcoming.aspx?Chamber=H&quot;&gt;will hold a public hearing&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;amp;Bill=HB2044&quot;&gt;HB 2044&lt;/a&gt;, which includes some open records provisions among many other provisions relating to police misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an opinion about a bill that’s up for public hearing, testifying at the committee meeting is the best way to speak up! You just need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mytxlegis.legis.state.tx.us/hwrspublic/about.aspx&quot;&gt;register to testify (at the Capitol)&lt;/a&gt; and then say why you support or oppose the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Government Under Debate in TX Legislature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that more than 60 days have passed since the start of the Texas legislative session, we’re past the deadline for legislators to file non-emergency bills. Here’s a rundown of bills that could have an effect on transparency and open government this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in contacting your legislators to support open data, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/&quot;&gt;openstates.org&lt;/a&gt; to find out whose districts you’re in and get their offices’ phone numbers. If you want to alert us to something we missed, or just join Open Austin’s discussion about policy, you can join the #policy channel in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.open-austin.org/&quot;&gt;Open Austin community on Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bills-that-increase-openness-in-government&quot;&gt;Bills that increase openness in government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB2044/&quot;&gt;HB 2044&lt;/a&gt; (authored by Senfronia Thompson, pictured below) has openness provisions about traffic stops and police discipline records, as well as provisions dealing with police use of force in other ways. It’s supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.austinjustice.org/&quot;&gt;Austin Justice Coalition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/SenfroniaThompson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Senfronia Thompson, author of HB 2044&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; display: block;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB2596/&quot;&gt;HB 2596&lt;/a&gt;, among other things, would require home-rule municipalities to provide GIS files of its boundaries and extra-territorial jurisdiction. It would also require the production of a digital map to accompany annexation plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/SB407/&quot;&gt;SB 407&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB792/&quot;&gt;HB 792&lt;/a&gt; would change the Public Information Act’s exception for contract bids, which contain competitive information. The bills would change the statute so that the exception didn’t apply once a contract was awarded. The Statesman published a Freedom of Information Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mystatesman.com/news/opinion/commentary-texas-must-repair-damage-public-information-act/5ZvyZur7pm5HEJqyzb8zDL/&quot;&gt;editorial strongly supporting these bills&lt;/a&gt;, which were introduced in response to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-supreme-court/1705303.html&quot;&gt;Texas Supreme Court case called &lt;em&gt;Boeing v. Paxton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Texas Tribune &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2016/08/05/lawmakers-eye-monstrous-loophole-keeps-contract-de/&quot;&gt;wrote about the &lt;em&gt;Boeing&lt;/em&gt; decision&lt;/a&gt;, saying it prevented disclosures about Uber’s operations in Houston, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mystatesman.com/news/opinion/commentary-texas-must-repair-damage-public-information-act/5ZvyZur7pm5HEJqyzb8zDL/&quot;&gt;same editorial in the Statesman&lt;/a&gt; Kelley Shannon, executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, endorsed two other bills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas and other open government advocates are pressing for additional transparency measures in the Legislature. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB2670/&quot;&gt;House Bill 2670&lt;/a&gt; attempts to improve access to public records stored in private email accounts and on private electronic devices. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB2710/&quot;&gt;House Bill 2710&lt;/a&gt; seeks to resume access to dates of birth in certain public records, including crime documents and election filings, which fosters accuracy and informs the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB793/&quot;&gt;HB 793&lt;/a&gt; would expand the definition of “governmental body” to particular contractors. This could include private entities that operate toll roads. According to the Statesman editorial, HB 793 would supersede the &lt;a href=&quot;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-supreme-court/1706354.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greater Houston Partnership&lt;/em&gt; Texas Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB623/&quot;&gt;HB 623&lt;/a&gt; would require the creation of a web portal for state criminal justice data including reports submitted to the Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bills-that-cut-back-on-open-government&quot;&gt;Bills that cut back on open government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB526/&quot;&gt;HB 526&lt;/a&gt; would amend the open-records statute to entitle only residents to public information. (Currently, anyone can submit a public-information request and governmental entities have a duty to fulfill them under the terms of the Government Code.) In addition to restricting the free flow of public information, this could be burdensome to both persons making requests and entities fulfilling them if the residence of the person requesting needs to be verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB1258/&quot;&gt;HB 1258&lt;/a&gt; would prevent anyone, including the state government, from allowing online public access to court records currently held by counties. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/texas-clerks-look-derail-web-based-public-access-court-records/pnNpmqoQlwe4s8xfBUZYbJ/&quot;&gt;state Office of Court Administration was planning on allowing access&lt;/a&gt; to the records through the state’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacer.gov/&quot;&gt;PACER&lt;/a&gt;-like database called “re:SearchTX”. Even though the fees for the state database will be exorbitant at up to $6 per document, Chief Justice Hecht of the Texas Supreme Court thinks it will be an improvement for people who can’t afford a lawyer. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2017/03/09/seeing-turf-war-texas-counties-rally-against-statewide-records-portal/&quot;&gt;Texas Tribune quotes Hecht&lt;/a&gt; as saying “We’re talking about tens of thousands of people for whom getting a court record is probably impossible, at least practically…It’s just crucial. It’s important for transparency. The media and the public at large have a very fundamental interest in the public justice system.” A bill that blocks the state’s court record database from becoming available to the public will probably be a negative for open government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstates.org/tx/bills/85/HB3107/&quot;&gt;HB 3107&lt;/a&gt; lets government bodies impose limits on the amount of records they’re required to disclose to a single requestor per month or year. The limits are determined by the amount of staff time used to produce the records, which creates the risk that governments will reduce their obligation to disclose records by using inefficient methods to produce the records. The limits don’t apply to employees of news organizations, but it could be burdensome for people with reasonable records requests to prove their requests are sponsored by a qualified organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Announcement: Budget Party Awarded Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund Grant</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Austin Budget Party has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning.mozilla.org/blog/mozilla-awards-241000-to-explore-the-intersection-of-gigabit-technology-and-civics-robotics-farming-and-more&quot;&gt;awarded a Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund grant&lt;/a&gt; to help design and develop a Digital Mock City Council experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://austinbudget.party/&quot;&gt;austinbudget.party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the grant is to create an online, open-source, digital budget debate platform and curriculum designed for middle and high school students to explore civic challenges and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Austin contributors partnered with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cotmf.org/&quot;&gt;Capital of Texas Media Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, publisher of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.austinmonitor.com/&quot;&gt;Austin Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, to apply for this $15,000 award to improve the budget app, develop a teaching curriculum, and implement the program in 10 pilots schools in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grant project builds on two existing initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin Budget Party is an open-source, mobile friendly, web app designed to engage the citizens of Austin over how city budgets are developed. Open Austin led the design and creation of this project through volunteer Civic Hack Nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cotmf.org/austinmonitorintheclassroom/&quot;&gt;Monitor in the Classroom&lt;/a&gt; offers local educators access to Austin Monitor content to create curriculum around current events and the practice of journalism. It is currently funded by Google Fiber’s Austin branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will start as an educational pilot curriculum including participation from 10 different classrooms from each council district through a grant from the Mozilla Foundation. Each classroom will use austinbudget.party to craft a budget that meets the needs of their immediate community, elect a mock City Council representative from their peers, and learn about debate and formal proceedings. Then, the ten mock Council Members will create a digital quorum and run a meeting to be hosted over a gigabit powered video conferencing solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this will be a finalized budget that the students would present to the Austin City Council during the formal period of citizen feedback on the proposal annual budget. Conditional upon the success of this pilot, the end product would be a robust curriculum and platform that could scale so that hundreds of students would simultaneously collaborate and learn from their peers all over the City breaking down the barriers of economic segregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using mobile technology solutions and high-speed internet connections, we aim to facilitate a realistic educational simulation where students learn by doing through mobile devices that meet them where they are in the digital world. Our team believes this type of learning experience can transform what has traditionally been possible in a classroom environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in following this project more closely or contributing yourself, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty&quot;&gt;project Github repo&lt;/a&gt; and join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.open-austin.org/&quot;&gt;#budgetparty Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2017: Our next challenge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When Open Austin was founded in 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/open&quot;&gt;Obama’s open data initiative&lt;/a&gt; was just getting started. A few years later in 2012, Code for America &lt;a href=&quot;http://kut.org/post/what-can-code-america-do-austin&quot;&gt;announced it would send its Fellows&lt;/a&gt; to inject tech talent into local government, including Austin as a pilot city. Five years ago, the White House recognized the first weekend in June as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/06/03/open-data-and-innovation-national-day-civic-hacking-2016&quot;&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt;, an event we co-present annually as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://atxhackforchange.org/&quot;&gt;ATX Hack for Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the eight years since our founding, the world is a different place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to juxtapose the history of Open Austin, and the larger national “Civic Tech” movement, with the presidential timeline. It reminds us just how young this work is. In 2017, our organization is experiencing its first presidential transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our 45th President, Donald J Trump, was inaugurated in DC last week. We’d like to reflect on highlights from 2016. Then we will lay out  our focus ahead for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2016-recap&quot;&gt;2016 Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;events&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We hosted or were invited to present at over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/open-austin/&quot;&gt;50 events&lt;/a&gt; including 17 Civic Hack Nights, 12 Civic Hack Saturdays, and 12 Open Gov &amp;amp; Civic Meetups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We co-presented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2016/06/07/Recap-ATX-Hack-for-Change-2016&quot;&gt;4th annual ATX Hack for Change&lt;/a&gt; hosted at St. Edward’s University.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We presented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2016/03/10/codeacross-austin-2016-recap&quot;&gt;6th Code Across Austin&lt;/a&gt; at St. Ed’s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We hosted two seperate “Design for Civic Solutions” workshops in partnership with Austin Center for Design, Austin Design Week, and the City of Austin Office of Innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We listened to 16 Lightning Talks and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2016/06/07/Recap-ATX-Hack-for-Change-2016&quot;&gt;24 blogs posts&lt;/a&gt; presented and written by members of our increasingly diverse community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We hosted a day long “Women Who Open Data” workshop co-presented with Women Who Code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We co-presented two Game Nights themed around Budget &amp;amp; Transportation with Glasshouse Policy &amp;amp; the Austin Monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We raised $7,220 from our generous friends at data.world, Ordoro, Cloudera, Google Fiber, Mozilla Hive, Dev Bootcamp, Blue Treble, USAA, Austin B-cyle, HubCiti, Vizias, and Code for America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advocacy&quot;&gt;Advocacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ipZ3_XVI6_k6K9EpRrV50rlq1RMGFzR9Z-RFG7Gnko/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Letter of Support&lt;/a&gt; and participated as a civil society partner in the City’s ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opengovpartnership.org/node/8960&quot;&gt;OGP Subnational Government Pilot Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our members collaborated to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-2yEphw1igKpaFQfSwPevWH3mMOACav9n-tDBViDro/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;2016 Advocacy Agenda&lt;/a&gt; with input from community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We provided pre-RFP recommendations to CoA Clerk office on Council Meetings &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FOLuCR6kRRTLQD5dyJCuIquRkEoaGi0aqAVlBFwVuPY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Agenda Management System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We continued our tradition of creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/candidate-questionnaires/2016.html&quot;&gt;Council Candidate Survey&lt;/a&gt; and redesigned how the qualitative information is presented. Content from our 2016 City Council Candidate survey was included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/austin-tech-alliance/id1164265992?mt=8&quot;&gt;ATA mobile app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;projects&quot;&gt;Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our community created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue%20created%3A2016-01-01..2016-12-31%20&quot;&gt;42 new project ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We updated our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2016/01/25/new-logo-same-mission&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; and launched a new website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Texas Appleseed gave us their Pro Bono Leadership Award at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://texasappleseed.org/good-apple-dinner&quot;&gt;Good Apple Dinner&lt;/a&gt; for our work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texasdisciplinelab.org/&quot;&gt;Texas School Discipline Lab&lt;/a&gt; helping to advocate for dismantling the school to prison pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our work in support of the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, ACLU of Texas, and Texans for Accountable Government in creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atxbodycam.com/&quot;&gt;atxbodycam.com&lt;/a&gt; was recognized on the main stage of the Code for America Summit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/iced-coffee/issues/130&quot;&gt;Civic Hack Canvas&lt;/a&gt; was forked and used in DC, Japan, and used by the City of Austin in a Transportation Grant challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2017&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Election of Donald J. Trump, we’ve seen an increased hunger from our community for projects and advocacy work that promotes the civic good. We believe the intersection of technology &amp;amp; government are vital for progress in our experiment in democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an all-volunteer organization, we labored to accomplish the achievements listed above. This year, we want to deepen our impact and try harder to support existing organizations in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, our coreteam has chosen three internal projects and we’d like your help with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openaustin.typeform.com/to/zyE0a4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply here to join our coreteam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We want to make it easier for volunteers to assume roles within the organization, on projects, and in planning. We want to accommodate varying levels of availability.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We brainstormed about our org model and decided it looks most like a snowflake ❄️. We invite you to imagine where you could plug in.
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/snowflake_model_2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/snowflake_model_2017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snowflake model of distributed leadership&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Values
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We know that if we want to fight hard battles in the next 4 years, we need to stand on a principled foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At our meetup in November 2016, we facilitated a collaborative design exercise to find language that describes the core values of Civic Tech.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Then we distilled these insights into a better reflection of Why we do our work.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The tangible outcome will be an updated About Page &lt;em&gt;(coming v soon)&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/values_group_2016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Group working on asset mapping the resource of our organization&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/civic_tech_values_postit.png&quot; alt=&quot;An example of 6 values a group choose for Civic Tech&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/values_2017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Organizing different values to interpret meaning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Official Partner Projecets (aka: Open Austin Labs)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We want to get better and support projects that have:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Formal partnerships with external stakeholders (like other non-profits or the City of Austin)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Clear goals and deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opportunities for funding via grants, contracts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A plan for open-source maintenance and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, we want to remain a friendly community where people come to learn, share, and collaborate with each other. We will need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please consider joining our snowflake ❄️❄️❄️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time to Back Up the Public's Climate Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the Obama administration in its last weeks, the Washington Post reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/&quot;&gt;“Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump”&lt;/a&gt;. Especially if you have experience working with environmental data or policy, now is a good time to think about whether you’ve encountered any valuable climate or emissions datasets in danger of being swept away in the coming transition. Organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ischool.utoronto.ca/content/guerrilla-archiving-event-saving-environmental-data-trump&quot;&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefugefaqs&quot;&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://climatemirror.org/&quot;&gt;climatemirror.org&lt;/a&gt; are creating archives to offer permanent mirrors for these climate datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datasets held by federal agencies aren’t the only ones that could be at risk. Environmental journalists recently noticed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/endangered-species-under-gop-climate-change-information-on-the-web&quot;&gt;climate change information had been purged from a Wisconsin state government website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth protecting not just environmental information from federal agencies like the EPA and NOAA, but also state agencies like the &lt;a href=&quot;www.tceq.texas.gov&quot;&gt;Texas Commission on Environmental Quality&lt;/a&gt;, and even cities and counties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out whether a particular dataset is being backed up or what you can do to help, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://climatemirror.org/&quot;&gt;climatemirror.org&lt;/a&gt; for a list of existing mirrors and a Google Doc showing which datasets are in progress. Some tools for archiving government websites are available from climatemirror and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving&quot;&gt;University of Toronto Github page&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, if your dataset is hotter than Texas in 2050 under a business-as-usual emissions projection, maybe you’d prefer to tell archivists about it privately. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://envirodatagov.org/&quot;&gt;Environmental Data &amp;amp; Governance Initiative&lt;/a&gt; is soliciting help accessing “environmental data that is not freely available on the web” via its encrypted email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in a more local dataset that’s outside the scope of the mirroring projects listed here, or if you have a plan to create something with the data beyond just backing it up, consider bringing your project idea to Open Austin. You can submit your idea as an issue on our Github group’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues&quot;&gt;project-ideas page&lt;/a&gt; or look for collaborators at one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Open-Austin/&quot;&gt;Civic Hack Nights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Austin can also be a resource for environmental data consumers who want to encourage governments to release new datasets, or to keep their existing data more timely or accessible. Contact us on the #policy channel of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.open-austin.org/&quot;&gt;Slack group&lt;/a&gt; if you have an issue you’d like to add to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/advocacy/&quot;&gt;advocacy agenda&lt;/a&gt; for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Austin Honored with Pro Bono Leadership Award from Texas Appleseed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many Texans see the evidence of the school-to-prison pipeline in their daily lives – sometimes because a video goes viral or because they are a parent, grandparent, or advocate for a child they love. Texas Appleseed has long been involved in working to address systemic problems related to zero-tolerance school disciplinary policies and hostile school climates – and they wanted a new forum to reach people and expand the dialogue around the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://texasappleseed.org/&quot;&gt;Texas Appleseed&lt;/a&gt; is a public interest justice center. This nonprofit works to change unjust laws and policies that prevent Texans from realizing their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas Appleseed approached us at Open Austin with the idea to create a website that would bring together advocates, students, parents, and educators in Texas who are interested in improving educational opportunities and outcomes for youth. Our volunteers stepped up to help, donating more than a year of pro bono time by building a new website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texasdisciplinelab.org/&quot;&gt;Texas School Discipline Lab&lt;/a&gt;, from scratch. Volunteers also designed and gathered data for several &lt;a href=&quot;https://txappleseed.github.io/txappleseedmap/&quot;&gt;interactive maps&lt;/a&gt; that feature discipline data from over 1,200 school districts across Texas, while offering their expertise on the best way to present data that would make it easy to understand, visually appealing, and accessible to various audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/good-apple-dinner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Good Apple Dinner program header&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, November 17, Open Austin representatives were presented with the &lt;em&gt;Pro Bono Leadership Award&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://texasappleseed.org/good-apple-dinner&quot;&gt;Texas Appleseed’s 20th Annual Good Apple Dinner&lt;/a&gt;. Open Austin is honored to support Texas Appleseed in one small aspect of this important work that will improve the lives of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Code for the School District Discipline Maps can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/txappleseed/txappleseedmap&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributors to this project include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patricia Silva&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Tyree&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>September Open Gov &amp; Civic Tech Meetup Recap-Data.World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Open-Austin/events/233380715/&quot;&gt;Monday’s Open Government and Civic Technology meetup&lt;/a&gt; had 2 guest speakers present. Doug Matthews, Chief Communication Officer, covered the state of the community registry. Jonathan Ortiz, Data Scientist and Knowledge Engineer at Data.world, spoke on the startup, his census project, and linked data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Getting started! 🙌🏼 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OmIGqIydo5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OmIGqIydo5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Open Austin (@openaustin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openaustin/status/778021336891346945&quot;&gt;September 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-registry-an-unexpected-journey&quot;&gt;Community Registry: an Unexpected Journey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug Matthews started the meeting by outlining the current state of the &lt;a href=&quot;assets/documents/community_registry_pitch.pdf&quot;&gt;Austin Community Registry&lt;/a&gt;. As described by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.austintexas.gov/page/community-registry-search&quot;&gt;data.gov&lt;/a&gt;—a community registry is a tool that allows for “neighborhoods and others to be notified of issues relating to their area”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kicking off the Convo on a community registry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/civictech?src=hash&quot;&gt;#civictech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7jYjw0oKvF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/7jYjw0oKvF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Open Austin (@openaustin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openaustin/status/778028797610176512&quot;&gt;September 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthews highlighted the current complexities of filling out the Austin registry and keeping it up to date. His slide examples showed how time consuming and frustrating current processes are. It is clear that a better and more interactive solution is needed. Streamlining the registry application and giving it more interactive capabilities would increase the value and functionality of this important community resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Google Fiber and the city are partnering up to push this project forward and find help to create the best solution for Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of challenges and opportunities in working on the community registry. You can get engaged and help tackle them by checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/78&quot;&gt;open project issue on github&lt;/a&gt; or reaching out to Doug by emailing douglas.matthews@austintexas.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night concluded with Jonathan Ortiz, a data scientist from &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.world/&quot;&gt;Data.world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data.world is a public benefit company working to break down the barriers between data and people. Unlike some companies, they’re not about the visualization or analysis of data. They’re about helping people find the data they need and enabling cross-collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan highlighted the sentiment that Data.world is about more than data though. He said, “It’s about making understanding easier”.  He also emphasized the benefits of social sharing and data by saying,” We should work together. We should collaborate. We should not duplicate our efforts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continued to explain that a lot of the data, though open and available, is being stood up and posted in silos. This means that other people can’t access it and might not even know about its existence. Having access to more relevant data could allow for more thorough research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Data providers are disconnected from data users. They load it in and you pull it out.&amp;quot;  - Jonathon Ortiz of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/datadotworld&quot;&gt;@datadotworld&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/z16mIT9iVs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/z16mIT9iVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Open Austin (@openaustin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openaustin/status/778046012560510976&quot;&gt;September 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a social platform isn’t the only way to share data though. Linked data holds many possibilites and it’s something the folks at Data.world are working on. &lt;a href=&quot;http://linkeddata.org/&quot;&gt;Linked data&lt;/a&gt; is what makes up the semantic web, which is also sometimes called a Research Description Framework or RDF. When you upload your data to Data.world there is the opportunity to link it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking data joins the data sets to others by following a set data model. This enables the data to be better understood by machines and thus allows users to discover more insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the linked data technology, Jonathan and Data.world partnered with the US Census Bureau. They aim to help data users by enriching the analyses that need US demographic information. They are doing this by working to ingest the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/&quot;&gt;American Community Survey&lt;/a&gt; in a linked data format. The project is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get an invite for Data.world and share some of your own data sets by visiting the following link: [https://data.world/preview-signup]&lt;/p&gt;
